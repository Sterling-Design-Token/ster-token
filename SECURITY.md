# Security Policy

The Sterling Design Token (STER) ecosystem prioritizes transparency, safety, and responsible disclosure.  
This document outlines how to report security concerns and what types of issues are in scope.

---

## 🔹 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue related to:

- Token metadata  
- Repository documentation  
- Transparency files  
- Marketplace integrations  
- On‑chain interactions  
- Wallet or LP references  

…please report it responsibly.

### **How to report:**

1. Open a **private issue** if available  
2. Or email the project maintainers (contact details will be added as official channels are finalized)  
3. Provide:
   - A clear description of the issue  
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
   - Any relevant links or screenshots  

Do **not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they are reviewed.

## 🔹 In‑Scope Issues

- Incorrect or misleading on‑chain references  
- Broken transparency links  
- Metadata inconsistencies  
- Documentation errors that could cause user confusion  
- Security concerns related to ecosystem integrations  
- Any issue that could mislead token holders or marketplace users  

---

## 🔹 Out‑of‑Scope Issues

- Personal wallet security (users are responsible for their own keys)  
- Issues unrelated to STER or SDMarketplace  
- Exchange‑specific bugs  
- Third‑party platform outages  
- Speculative or theoretical vulnerabilities without evidence  

---

## 🔹 Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible, good‑faith reporting.  
All valid reports will be reviewed promptly, and fixes will be documented in the repo.

Thank you for helping maintain the integrity and safety of the STER ecosystem.
