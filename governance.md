# STER Governance Overview

STER governance is built on transparency, strict wallet separation, and predictable on‑chain behavior.  
Each wallet has a single purpose, and all actions are logged publicly to maintain long‑term trust and ecosystem integrity.

---

## 🔹 Governance Principles

The STER ecosystem follows four core governance principles:

- **Clear separation of responsibilities**  
  Each wallet performs one role only, with no overlap.

- **Predictable on‑chain behavior**  
  All movements are intentional, infrequent, and aligned with documented rules.

- **Transparency first**  
  Every action is publicly verifiable through Solscan and this repository.

- **Long‑term sustainability**  
  Governance is designed to prevent misuse, ambiguity, or centralization of control.
