## 🔹 Launch‑Day LP Structure

At launch, the LP was created using:

- A one‑time deposit of STER  
- A matching deposit of USDC  
- A fixed ratio to establish the initial market price  

After creation, the LP tokens were locked to ensure long‑term trust and immutability.

## 🔹 Governance Rules for LP Management

To maintain transparency and prevent misuse, the LP follows strict governance rules:

- LP tokens remain locked  
- No LP tokens are withdrawn  
- No LP tokens are used for operational expenses  
- No LP tokens are used for marketing or incentives  
- No LP tokens are used for micro‑trades  
- Any future LP adjustments require governance approval  

The LP is intentionally static to protect holders and maintain ecosystem integrity.
